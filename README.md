### A two-dimensional predator-prey simulation (a variation on the Game of Life)

In this simulation the prey are ants and the predators are doodlebugs.
These critters live in a world composed of a 20 Ã— 20 grid of cells. Only one critter
may occupy a cell at a time. The grid is enclosed, so a critter is not allowed to move
off the edges of the world. Time is simulated in time steps. Each critter performs
some action every time step.

**The ants behave according to the following model:**<br /><br />
*Move*: Every time step, randomly try to move up, down, left, or right. If the neighboring cell in the
selected direction is occupied or would move the ant off the grid, then the ant stays in the
current cell.<br /><br />
*Breed*: If an ant survives for three time steps, then at the end of the time step (that is; after
moving) the ant will breed. This is simulated by creating a new ant in an adjacent (up, down, left,
or right) cell that is empty. If there is no empty cell available, then no breeding occurs. Once an
off-spring is produced, an ant cannot produce an offspring until three more time steps have
elapsed.<br /><br /><br />

**The doodlebugs behave according to the following model:**<br/><br />
*Move*: Every time step, if there is an adjacent ant (up, down, left, or right), then the doodlebug
will move to that cell and eat the ant. Otherwise, the doodlebug moves according to the same
rules as the ant. Note that a doodlebug cannot eat other doodlebugs.<br/><br />
*Breed*: If a doodlebug survives for eight time steps, then at the end of the time step it will spawn
off a new doodlebug in the same manner as the ant.<br/><br />
*Starve*: If a doodlebug has not eaten an ant within the last three time steps, then at the end of
the third time step it will starve and die. The doodlebug should then be removed from the grid of
cells.
